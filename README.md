# Glazba
Glazba is a web-application which lets you upload, store, listen and download all your music from the cloud. 
Glaza allows you to manage and play your music from anywhere and in the world.

This is how the site looks...

The user can add albums of his/her own choice

The songs for those albums can then be added from the album section and can be played, managed accordingly

This is the first version of the site. Everything except the music player has been implemented.
The music player will be added shortly.
